By the end of the course, students will have developed a research project that investigates a question within economics. This will include understanding economic theories and using them to frame their research, preparing and analyzing data to answer research questions, and documenting the research process so that others may understand their results. Past student-research teams have examined questions such as… How are the locations of substance abuse treatment centers related to nearby crime? Crime and Substance Abuse Treatment Project Are young adults more likely to follow into their parents careers when the labor market is more competitive? NepoBabies Project Does the number of workers employed in an establishment have an effect on workplace safety? Workplace Accidents Project 1.1 Day-to-Day in ECN 310 Students will learn the research process through readings and short lectures as well as through hands-on workshops and challenges. Prior to class, students will engage with readings as a primer to the activities for that day. Brief reading quizzes (completed on Blackboard before class) will ask about the main ideas and important details from the reading. During class, Professor Buzard will briefly review the ideas from the readings and then jump into a short lecture on the related skills students will learn that day. Then, class-time is given for hands-on engagement with the topics, and students will receive support from Professor Buzard, the teaching assistant, and each other. Only about a dozen students will be in one section of ECN 310, which gives Professor Buzard and the TA the ability to support students as they learn research skills. Other than readings, work outside of class time will consist of completing assignments from the in-class workshops (if necessary), and working on the team research project. 1.2 Course Project and Skills The best way to learn how to do research is to do it yourself! At the beginning of the course, students will learn about potential research questions posed by economists at Syracuse University and then will team up with classmates to form a research team that seeks to answer their chosen question. The team’s work will culminate in a research report that describes the context of the topic they studied, how they performed their analysis, and what their results mean for the issues they studied and for future research on the topic. The team will also detail the steps they took to achieve their final results so that other researchers can replicate their results and understand their decisions. Once students complete this course, they will have expanded their skills so that they can perform research at a higher level in the future. ECN 310 provides a foundation for those who intend to be engaged with research in their academic and professional careers. 1.2.1 Research Tools GitHub is the software used in this course that helps us communicate, document, and organize the research process. We can store files with code and data for our own records and to share with others. We can discuss the latest updates in our research. We can also keep track of the research process. When we write something on GitHub, we use Markdown, which means we use short commands to format our writing. See more in the GitHub section. LaTeX is a tool that helps you write documents, especially ones with math and figures, in a neatly formatted way. Instead of clicking buttons to make text bold or add equations like in Word or Docs, you type short commands that tell the computer how you want the document to look. You give the computer instructions for how your paper should appear, and then it puts the whole document together for you. See more in the LaTeX section. Stata is a powerful app with a user-friendly interface that is used widely by researchers in economics, sociology, political science, public health, and more. We will use it extensively for data management, analysis, and visualization. See more in the Stata section. 1.2.2 Technical Skills Coding just means giving the computer a set of instructions using a specific language so it can do something for you — like analyze data, make a graph, or format a document. In programs like Stata, R, GitHub, and LaTeX, you’ll write these instructions in a structured way the computer understands. Students will work with data analytics tools to explore their research question. These include statistical tests, data visualizations, and more. We use code to produce these results, but students will also learn what these tools are and when to use them. Comprehending economic research is critical for framing a research question and hypothesizing what relationships may exist between the factors being studied. Students will learn how to read economics papers, identify economic theories, and use those theories to guide their research. Academic writing, especially when working with data, is different from the types of writing students may be familiar with. Students will learn how to carefully describe their data and analysis in the context of the research question and in the context of previous findings related to their project. 1.2.3 Soft Skills Presentation: There will be many opportunities for students to present parts of their research to classmates, Professor Buzard, and the TA. This gives students the opportunity to receive feedback on their work and to hone their presentation skills. Collaboration &amp; teamwork: The research project in this course takes place in a team setting. Research teams consist of three to four students that will work together to answer their research question and document their findings. 1.3 Course Purpose and Benefits Now, you should have a better understanding of what you will learn and accomplish in ECN 310: Economic Research in Practice. This course will prepare you to be successful in future research endeavors and courses, as well as education beyond past college. Syracuse Economics This course prepares students to succeed in the methods courses they will encounter later in the Economics degree. B.S. students will be ready for ECN 521 and 522, which emphasize applied research techniques in econometrics. B.A. students will be prepared for ECN 422, which focuses on foundational econometric methods suited to the (non-research) B.A. track. Students who aspire to pursue research in Economics (including the Distinction Program and Honors Thesis) are recommended to follow the B.S. path. Economics Degrees Beyond Undergrad Students interested in graduate school will be better prepared by learning about the fundamentals of research. Most graduate degrees–most Master’s and all Phds–involve a significant research portion. By taking ECN 310, you can build up research skills that will be helpful in graduate school. You can also build your research portfolio so that graduate schools can see you have research experience. If you are interested in earning a Master’s degree in Economics, Syracuse University offers an accelerated program with the B.S. track. More on this here. Research Careers Many careers, within economics and beyond, rely on research. ECN 310 will give you many transferable skills, like working with data and communicating your findings, that are critical for succeeding in a career that involves research–in any industry. You will be given hands-on experience to learn these skills, and by the end of the course you will have a paper that demonstrates your skillset. 1.4 What You Can Do Now ECN 310 is designed to be accessible to students with zero coding or research experience. That means you are not required or expected to do anything with this information before starting ECN 310. At the same time, here we provide some resources so you can get comfortable with the tools we use in ECN 310 if you want to. The easiest first step is to learn about Markdown (instructions here), which is a set of commands we will use to format text on Github. You could also put your Markdown skills to work by accessing Github (instructions here), although you may not see most of the benefits of Github until we start using it for collaboration once class starts. If you like that and want to go a step further, you can try out LaTeX (instructions here). LaTeX does a lot of the same things as Markdown, but it can do much more. That is why we use it to write the final papers! These commands are a little more complex than ones used on GitHub. Another possibility is to start experimenting with Stata. There are instructions (here) to get access to the app, and (here) to follow the textbook we’ll use this fall to try out some of what Stata can do. "],["github-section.html", "2 GitHub 2.1 GitHub-Flavored Markdown 2.2 Joining GitHub 2.3 More On Using GitHub", " 2 GitHub GitHub is the platform we use in ECN 310 to communicate with each other; to store the code, data, and other files used for the team research project; and to submit assignments. GitHub is a widely used platform (over 100 million users), especially by those who work on and share code. On GitHub, you can work in different “repositories,” which are spaces for users to work on one project. For example, your research project will have its own repository where your team members, Professor Buzard, and the TA will collaborate. When writing a post on GitHub, you will use something called GitHub-flavored markdown to format your post. Markdown language consists of typed short commands, like pound signs or underscores, for formatting. Instead of clicking a button that would bold a portion of text, you would surround it with two asterisks, **like so.** 2.1 GitHub-Flavored Markdown Here is a list of markdown commands. You can look through them to see how different commands are used to produce different formatting. You can also test out the commands in the GitHub-flavored markdown sandbox. On the left side of the sandbox is where you can type out commands and text and the right side will show you what each command does.You can test out the different commands from the list and see what they do. If you’re going to try out any one thing before class starts, this is the one to try! It’s an easy introduction to how coding works, and we will use it every day in class assignments. 2.2 Joining GitHub If you want to join GitHub and test out your markdown skills there, you can use the link below and follow these instructions: Go to https://github.com/signup Enter your username, email, and password. Please choose a clear and professional username, as this is the account you will use in class. For example, Professor Buzard’s username is @kbuzard, simply her first initial and last name. Solve the puzzle and click “Create account” Follow instructions to verify email address 2.3 More On Using GitHub Once you have signed up to become a GitHub user, you can navigate through its different tools to get an understanding of its purpose. If you want to view an example of a repository from a past ECN 310 team, you can refer to the course-project-zipcentercrime repository and follow along with the guide below. The homepage of a repository, called the “Code” tab, is where you can see all of the files being stored on the repository. Many repositories will also have a “README” at the bottom of the homepage. This tells users what the repository’s purpose is. Other important tabs of a repository are “Issues” and “Discussions.” These are places for repository users to discuss the work being done for their project and interact on the tasks at hand. You will use GitHub-flavored markdown to write posts on both issues and discussion. Users can also be assigned to issues in a repository, so that users know which members are working on each task. Once the tasks related to that issue are finished, the issue can be “closed,” and the issue can also be re-opened as needed. When you are on a repository’s homepage, you can see beneath the repository’s name (on the top left) a button that says “main.” This refers to which “branch” of the repository you are viewing. Branches are made by users in order to make changes to files in the repository without affecting the main version’s files. Branches are safe workplaces to experiment that let you work independently, but on the same repository. Once the changes on a branch have been made, the user can open a “pull request.” This allows you to propose the changes from a branch to be merged into the main branch. Then, the changes can be viewed and edited before being approved. Pull requests help ensure that code is reviewed and tested before they become part of the main project, which is especially important when working on a team. Another aspect of GitHub that we use in ECN 310 is called GitHub Desktop. Until now, you have only been viewing a repository from GitHub’s website, where you can view all the files, communication spaces, and pull requests. But, when using the GitHub Desktop app synced to your computer, you can open and edit all of a repository’s files. Then, you can “push” the changes to GitHub’s website, and those changes will be shown for each user of the repository. We recommend that you wait to download and experiment with GitHub Desktop until in-person in ECN 310. While incredibly useful, setting up GitHub Desktop sometimes presents unique challenges for each person/computer. In class, Professor Buzard and the TA can help to solve these issues. "],["latex-section.html", "3 LaTeX 3.1 Practice LaTeX 3.2 Join and Experiment with Overleaf", " 3 LaTeX Similar to GitHub flavored markdown used for posts on GitHub, LaTeX is a markup language that is used to write documents in a very organized manner by typing short commands. LaTeX commands are more customizable and are longer than GitHub flavored markdown commands. In ECN 310, we use the LaTeX markup language to write the final paper. The platform in which we write LaTeX documents is a free website called Overleaf. LaTeX is the language and gives commands on what the document should look like, and Overleaf is the system used to understand the language and produce the document. Here’s an example of how Github-flavored markdown and LaTeX compare: In GitHub, text is italicized by placing underscores around it, _like so_ But in LaTeX, text is italicized by using a command \\textit{like so} There are also commands that are used to structure the document. If an author wanted the document to have a section header called “Introduction”, the author would use the following command: \\section{Introduction} 3.1 Practice LaTeX You can read through this explainer from Overleaf on how LaTeX is used to structure and format documents to make them polished and professional. If you want to test out using LaTeX, you can use this LaTeX sandbox to experiment with creating simple documents. 3.2 Join and Experiment with Overleaf You can also make an account on Overleaf and view templates to see how LaTeX used in Overleaf creates well-formatted documents. To join Overleaf, click on this link and sign up! You can use a personal or school email. Once you are registered for Overleaf, you can see how LaTeX commands form a document by looking at the templates that Overleaf provides. You can find many here. These may look long and complex, but these files become manageable once you start working with them. There are also plenty of resources on the web that can help you figure out what commands mean and where to use them. If you have a question, we suggest two options for getting it answered: Look in the Overleaf documentation, found here: https://www.overleaf.com/learn. Put your question in either Google or your favorite AI companion (both ChatGPT and claude.ai work well for these kinds of questions). This is good practice–you’ll often use these tools in the process of learning to code for ECN 310. When you begin making your own LaTeX file in Overleaf for your course project, you will start with a template provided by Professor Buzard. You can view it with this link. As you can see in the ECN 310 template, the document does not start out with too many commands. When building and writing your project, you will use more LaTeX commands to add features to your paper, such as tables and figures. If you want to see the LaTeX file from a past ECN 310 team, you can look at the zip-center-crime’s. "],["stata-section.html", "4 Stata 4.1 Stata Basics 4.2 Stata Exercise 4.3 Learning More on Stata", " 4 Stata There are many different coding languages used to handle and analyze data. You have probably heard of some, like Python, R, SQL, Java, and more. In ECN 310, we use a coding language and platform called Stata. We choose to use Stata because it is a preference among many economists and will prepare you for further economic research opportunities. Stata is the name for both the commands used to tell the computer what to do (the coding language, like LaTeX), and it is the name for the system used to understand the commands and perform actions (like Overleaf). Many actions can be performed in Stata either by typing out commands or by using a point-and-click interface, meaning that you can also click buttons to perform analyses and make data visualizations. If you want to get a feel for how Stata works, you can access it through Syracuse University’s Remote Desktop Service (RDS). Stata is a proprietary language, meaning that it must be paid for to use it. The university pays for access to Stata, but you must access it through a university computer, which can either be through the RDS on your own computer, or on a desktop computer in a university building (Bird Library, for example). To access the RDS through your browser, go to http://rds.syr.edu. Then, sign in using your university email and password like you would to access MySlice. Detailed instructions from the university can be found here. Once you are on the RDS, you can search for the Stata app. 4.1 Stata Basics When opening the Stata app, you will see five panels (and a bar at the bottom). These carry information on the data you work with in Stata and how you interact with it. The Command panel at the bottom is where you type out commands to the computer. Remember: you communicate to the computer by writing in the Stata programming language, and the computer receives commands and reports back to you in the Stata app. In the command window, you type out commands and send them by pressing the “Enter” or “Return” button on your keyboard. The “Results” window in the center displays the results of your commands. The “History” window on the left shows you a history of previously sent commands. The “Variables” window lists the variables in your current dataset. Right now it’s empty since no dataset is loaded. The “Properties” window shows detailed information about the dataset and selected variables. The file path bar at the bottom shows the location on your computer where you are reading files from. Another way to think about the file path is that it tells you where on your computer Stata is currently searching for your files - it shows you which digital folder is currently open. 4.2 Stata Exercise If you want to test out how Stata works, follow along for this brief exercise. In the Command window, type out sysuse census. You can also copy and paste the words between the apostrophes (excluding the apostrophes) into the command window. Then press Enter on your keyboard. As you can see, this loads in a dataset called “census”. This dataset contains 1980 U.S. Census data aggregated to the state level. In the Variables window, you can see the names and labels of the variables. A variable called “state” is the first one, followed by “state2”, “region”, “pop”, and more. You can also see in the History window that the command you just typed is stored there. Next, type browse into your command window and hit enter. This will open up another window where you can view all of the data currently loaded into Stata. You can look around to see what’s interesting and exit the window when you are done. Type in list in 1/3 into the Command window and hit enter. This shows the first three state’s values for each of the variables. You can see that the command tells Stata to make a list of the first three observations. The language of many commands is similar to this, where you type in abbreviated or short-hand English. Type summarize pop into the Command window and hit enter. In the Results window, you will see that you get information on the pop variable, like how many observations there are, the average (or mean), the standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values. Type scatter death marriage into the Command window and hit enter. This should display a scatterplot of each state’s number of deaths and number of marriages values. Each dot represents one state. You can exit this window when you are done viewing it. Note that it will not save anywhere (but you can re-create it with the same command later). So far, we have just viewed the data. We can also edit it. Let’s create a new variable. Right now, the pop variable shows the number of people in each state. We can create a variable that will show how many million people live in each state. Type generate pop_millions = pop / 1000000 and hit enter. Then type label variable pop_millions \"Population in millions\" and hit enter. You can now see in the Variables window that you have a new variable called “pop_millions” that is labeled with “Population in millions”. You can type “summarize pop_millions” to confirm that you have made this new variable and see that the average population of each state in 1980, in millions, is about 4.5. When you are done experimenting in Stata, you can simply close out of the Stata window. Note that when you close out of the Stata window, none of the data or work you did will be saved. For now, that is okay. Saving your work can become tricky when working with Stata, GitHub, and multiple different files of data and code. We will practice this together in class. 4.3 Learning More on Stata For now, we recommend that you pause here in learning Stata. More instruction will be coming soon on how you can use one of the course textbooks, An Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis Using Stata® : From Research Design to Final Report, authored by Lisa Daniels and Nicholas Minot. The textbook can be viewed online through Syracuse University’s online library here. In ECN 310, you will do a short reading before each class (like from the Daniels &amp; Minot textbook), and you will be asked to complete a reading quiz on Blackboard. But, you get to know the exact questions that will be on the quiz! This is because Professor Buzard gives you a “quiz prep” document on Blackboard that contains each of the questions, so you can mark down the answers as you read. Here are two example quiz prep documents that ask you to read a portion of the Daniels &amp; Minot textbook and interact with the reading. You can view the quiz prep documents for the Introduction to Stata and Data Cleaning &amp; Checking for Outliers sections of Daniels &amp; Minot. If you want to mimic what you would do in class, you can… Read the textbook section Answer the questions on the quiz prep as you read The final step would be to take the quiz based on how you answered the quiz prep questions.
